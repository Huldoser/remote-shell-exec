##Project purpose:
This project is made for my educational purposes to get a better understanding of the Node.js runtime, including some frameworks like Express.

While the latest stable Node.js version is still not fully supporting the ES6 standard (As you can check [here](http://node.green/)), I encouraged myself to use it whenever possiable.



##License
This project have no license and everyone can do whatever is on their mind including but not limited to marging, selling, changing, copying it and so on.
